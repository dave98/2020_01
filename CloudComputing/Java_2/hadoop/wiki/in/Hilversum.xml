'''Hilversum''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈɦɪlvərsʏm|-|Nl-Hilversum.ogg}}) is a [[List of cities in the Netherlands by province|city]] and [[List of municipalities of the Netherlands|municipality]] in the [[Provinces of the Netherlands|province]] of [[North Holland]], [[Netherlands]]. Located in the heart of the [[Gooi]], it is the largest urban centre in that area. It is surrounded by [[heathland]], [[Forest|wood]]s, [[meadow]]s, lakes, and smaller towns. Hilversum is part of the [[Randstad]], one of the largest [[conurbation]]s in [[Europe]].

== Town ==
Hilversum lies {{convert|24|km|abbr=on}} south-east of [[Amsterdam]] and {{convert|15|km|abbr=on}} north of [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]. The town is known for its architecturally important [[Hilversum Town Hall|Town Hall (Raadhuis Hilversum)]], designed by [[Willem Marinus Dudok]] and built in 1931.

Hilversum has one public library, two swimming pools (Van Hellemond Sport and De Lieberg), a number of sporting halls and several shopping centres (such as Hilvertshof, Winkelcentrum Kerkelanden, De Riebeeckgalerij and Winkelcentrum Seinhorst). Locally, the town centre is known as ''het dorp'', which means "the village".

=== Broadcasting ===
Hilversum is often called "media city", since it is the principal centre for radio and television broadcasting in the Netherlands, and is home to an extensive complex of radio and television [[studio]]s and to the administrative headquarters of the multiple broadcasting organizations which make up the [[Netherlands Public Broadcasting]] system. Hilversum is also home to many newer commercial TV production companies. [[Radio Netherlands]], which has been broadcasting worldwide via [[shortwave radio]] since the 1920s, is also based here.

The following is a list of organizations that have, or are continuing to, broadcast from studios in Hilversum:

One result of the town's history as an important radio transmission centre is that many older radio sets throughout Europe featured ''Hilversum'' as a pre-marked dial position on their tuning scales.

Dutch national voting in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] is normally co-ordinated from Hilversum.

===International===

Hilversum has a variety of international schools, such as the ''Violenschool'' and ''International School Hilversum "Alberdingk Thijm"''. Also, [[Nike,_Inc.|Nike]]'s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jobs.nike.com/ehq|title=Nike European Headquarters|website=jobs.nike.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Hunkemöller]]'s&lt;ref&gt;[[Talk:Hilversum#cite note-2]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}} and [[Converse_(shoe_company)|Converse]]'s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jobs.converse.com/locations|title=Locations|website=jobs.converse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; European headquarters are located in Hilversum.

== History ==
Earthenware found in Hilversum gives its name to the [[Hilversum culture]], which is an early- to mid-Bronze Age, or 800–1200 BC [[material culture]]. Artifacts from this prehistoric civilization bear similarities to the Wessex Culture of southern Britain and may indicate that the first Hilversum residents emigrated from that area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iguide.travel/Hilversum/Overview/History |title=Hilversum: Overview - History |publisher=Iguide.travel |accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first brick settlements formed around 900, but it was not until 1305 that the first official mention of Hilversum ("Hilfersheem" from "Hilvertshem" meaning "houses between the hills") is found. At that point it was a part of [[Naarden]], the oldest town in the Gooi area.

[[File:Johannes Bosboom - Interieur van een boerendeel bij Hilversum.jpg|thumb|left|''Interior of a farm near Hilversum'', a 19th-century drawing by [[Johannes Bosboom]]]]
Farming, raising sheep and some wool manufacturing were the means of life for the Gooi in the Middle Ages. In 1424 Hilversum received its first official independent status. This made possible further growth in the village because permission from Naarden was no longer needed for new industrial development.

The town grew further in the 17th century when the Dutch economy as a whole entered its age of prosperity, and several canals were built connecting it indirectly to Amsterdam. 

In 1725 and 1766 large fires destroyed most of the town, leveling parts of the old townhouse and the church next to it. The town overcame these setbacks and the textile industry continued to develop, among other ways by devising a way to weave cows' hair.

In the 19th century a substantial textile and tapestry industry emerged, aided by a railway link to Amsterdam in 1874.  From that time the town grew quickly with rich commuters from Amsterdam moving in, building themselves large villas in the wooded surroundings, and gradually starting to live in Hilversum permanently.  Despite this growth, Hilversum was never granted [[city rights in the Low Countries|city rights]] so it is still referred to by many locals as "het dorp," or "the village."

For the [[1928 Summer Olympics]] in neighboring [[Amsterdam]], it hosted all of the non-jumping [[Equestrian at the 1928 Summer Olympics|equestrian]] and the running part of the [[Modern pentathlon at the 1928 Summer Olympics|modern pentathlon]] event.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080408184510/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1928/1928.pdf 1928 Summer Olympics official report.] pp. 271–8.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Nederlandse Seintoestellen Fabriek'' (NSF) company established a professional transmitter and radio factory in Hilversum in the early 1920s, growing into the largest of its kind in the Netherlands.

Following the [[Battle of the Netherlands|defeat of Allied forces in the Netherlands]] in 1940, and its occupation by [[Nazi Germany]], Hilversum became the headquarters of the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] (''Heer'') in the Netherlands.{{citation needed|reason=Time reference needed|date=April 2015}}.

In 1948, NSF was taken over by [[Philips]]. However, Dutch radio broadcasting organizations (followed by television broadcasters during the 1950s) centralised their operations in Hilversum, providing a source of continuing economic growth.  The concentration of broadcasters in Hilversum has given it its enduring status as the media city for the Netherlands.

In 1964, the population reached a record high – over 103,000 people called Hilversum home. However, the textile industry had started its decline; only one factory, Veneta, managed to continue into the 1960s, when it also had to close its doors. Another major industry, the chemical factory IFF, also closed by the end of the 1960s. 

After the 1960s, the population gradually declined, until stabilising at around 85,000.  Several factors other than the slump in manufacturing have featured in this decline: one is the fact that the average family nowadays consists of fewer people, so fewer people live in each house; second, the town is virtually unable to expand because all the surrounding lands were sold by city architect [[Willem Marinus Dudok|W.M. Dudok]] to the [[Goois Natuurreservaat]] (''[[:nl:Goois Natuurreservaat|nl]]''). The third reason for this decline of the population was because the property values were increasing rapidly in that moment of time, and many people were forced to move to less expensive areas in the Netherlands.

Some sources blame connections in the television world for attracting crime to Hilversum;{{cn|date=December 2018}} the town has had to cope with mounting drug-related issues in a community with higher than average unemployment and ongoing housing shortage.

Hilversum was one of the first towns to have a local party of the populist movement called [[Livable Netherlands|''Leefbaar'' ("liveable")]]. Founded by former social-democrat party strongman Jan Nagel, it was initially held at bay for alderman positions. In 2001, Nagel from Leefbaar Hilversum teamed up with Leefbaar Utrecht leaders to found a national Leefbaar Nederland party. By strange coincidence, in 2002 the most vocal Leefbaar Rotterdam politician [[Pim Fortuyn]] was shot and killed by an animal rights activist at [[Media Park (Hilversum)|Hilversum Media Park]] just after finishing a radio interview. This happened, however, after a break between Fortuyn and Nagel during a Leefbaar Nederland board meeting in Hilversum on Fortuyn's anti-Islamic viewpoints.

The town of Hilversum has put a great deal of effort into improvements, including a recent renovation to its central train station, thorough renovation of the main shopping centre (Hilvertshof), and development of new dining and retail districts downtown including the "vintage" district in the Leeuwenstraat.  Several notable architectural accomplishments include the [[Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision|Institute for Sound and Vision]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://experience.beeldengeluid.nl/index.aspx?chapterID=7878 |title=Beeld en Geluid |publisher=Experience.beeldengeluid.nl |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091118210918/http://experience.beeldengeluid.nl/index.aspx?chapterID=7878 |archivedate=18 November 2009 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Zanderij Crailoo]] (''[[:nl:Natuurbrug Zanderij Crailoo|nl]]''), the largest man-made [[wildlife crossing]] in the world.

The nearby [[Media Park (Hilversum)|Media Park]] was the scene of [[Assassination of Pim Fortuyn|the 2002 assassination]] of politician [[Pim Fortuyn]]; in 2015, a gunman carrying a false pistol stormed into [[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting]]'s headquarters, demanding airtime on the evening news.

The population declined from 103,000 in 1964 to 84,000 in 2006, but rose again to 90.000 in 2018. The decline is mostly due to the fact that families are smaller these days.

'''Government'''

After the 2018 elections, the municipal government was made up of aldermen from the political parties Hart voor Hilversum, D66 and VVD.

The mayor of Hilversum is [[Pieter Broertjes]], former lead editor of the Volkskrant, a nationwide distributed newspaper.

It was the first city with a "[[Livable Netherlands|Leefbaar]]" party (which was intended as just a local party). Today, Leefbaar Hilversum has been reduced to only 1 seat, but some other parties have their origins in Leefbaar Hilversum:
* Hart voor Hilversum. Originated from a Leefbaar Hilversum separation party called DLPH, which won 1 seat in the 2006 elections. Leadership was taken over in 2006 by Leonie Sazias, a TV celebrity. Leonie Sazias later changed the party name to Hart voor Hilversum. She won 3 seats in the 2010 elections and increased her influence to 6 seats in 2014. They won the 2018 elections and have 8 seats now.
* Hilversum 1. Was founded by Hans Roos, originally a council member for Hart voor Hilversum, but due to disagreements with the party on the list of candidates for the elections in 2014, decided to split and start his own party in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dichtbij.nl/t-gooi/regionaal-nieuws/artikel/3272284/hans-roos-door-als-hilversum-1.aspx|title=Hans Roos door als Hilversum 1|last=regio|first=dichtbij.nl – nieuws en informatie uit de|date=2013-12-16|newspaper=dichtbij.nl|access-date=2016-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
